# Inbox

Inbox is my first GNOME App.

#### Nowadays, it has two goals:

1. Improve my skills in app develepment (GNOME, GTK);
2. Be a usefull tool to capture ideas (like GTD/ZTD approaches).

The idea is to use it when we are in deep work and don't want to stop. 
On the other hand, put the ideas in a place and process them later.

#### My imagined use:

1. Open the app with a shortcut;
2. Capture the idea;
3. Close it;
4. Later, open a file with the ideas and process them.
